Proceed directly to section 2, to know the mathematical proof. For a brief introduction, procees to next section.

## A Brief Introduction

Here's what [wikipedia]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox") says about the Simpson's Paradox.

>Simpson's paradox, ..., is a phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined


Let's illustrate this with an example.

<!-- # The Drug -->

## Mermaid

Install mermaid using `node.js` package manager `npm` by running the following command:
```bash
npm install -g mermaid.cli
```

The diagram below was generated by the following code:

{% raw %}
```
{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram
    participant John
    participant Alice
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram
    participant 
    participant Alice
    Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
    John-->>Alice: Great!
{% endmermaid %}
